It was pretty primitive at the time, and lot of things has happened since that.</p>

<p><strong>SPOILER: <a href="http://rada.re/con">Radare2&rsquo;s Congress Announcement</a></strong></p>

<p>The tool was mainly used and written by me (<a href="https://twitter.com/trufae">@pancake</a>) from the very first days. I was missing many interesting features in the opensource reverse engineering so I decided to collect and integrate all the interesting things that could fit on top of an abstracted IO layer, from disassemblers to debuggers or filesystems.</p>

<p>Personally I have been doing talks, trainings and writting documentation, though even it hadn&rsquo;t got much contributors or enough community interest, but it was ok. It was just a personal project I was having fun with.</p>

<p>During the last 4 years, the project got some international attention thanks to new contributors (xvilka, jvoisin, crowell, ret2libs, alvarofe, maijin, and many others!). Actually there are about 400 users on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/radare">IRC</a> + <a href="https://telegram.me/joinchat/ACR-FgWyg1bbu9YUzT_5pg">Telegram</a> chats. The amount of contributors <a href="https://github.com/radare/radare2/graphs/contributors">grows</a> on every new release.</p>

<p>The current state of the project makes me switch from author/developer role to leader/maintainer. This change implies much more things that it seems at first sight.</p>

<p>To start with, testing <a href="https://github.com/radare/radare2-regressions">regressions</a>, managing <a href="https://github.com/radare/radare2/issues">bugs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/radare/radare2/milestones">milestones</a> becomes much more important than before.</p>

<p>Being able to organize a Summers Of Code (<a href="http://rada.re/rsoc/2016/">RSoC</a> and <a href="http://radare.re/gsoc/2016">GSoC</a>) and instructing contributors to follow the project&rsquo;s indentation rules and doing several reviews on every single pull request makes the community much more stronger and the final product can be trusted much more.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s still a lot of work in the infrastructure side to enhance: enabling https, <em>dockerifying</em> the entire service setup, automating the Android and iOS builds, polishing the windows installer, automating packages building, etc.</p>

<p>The size of the community right now is big enough to be able to organise congress around the tool. There&rsquo;s people around the world using r2 for their own use or at company, automating malware analysis, solving crackmes, reverse engineering firmwares, carving memory, &hellip;</p>

<p>In order to celebrate the 10<sup>th</sup> aniversary of the project I&rsquo;m happy to anounce the first ever edition of the r2con! It will be the 8<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> of September, in Barcelona!</p>

<p>You may find more information about the talks in the <a href="http://rada.re/con">official webpage</a>: See you there!</p>
